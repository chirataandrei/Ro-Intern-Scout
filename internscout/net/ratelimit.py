"""Per-host throttling so a thread pool can fetch many companies concurrently
without hammering any single ATS host faster than REQUEST_GAP_SECONDS.

job-boards.greenhouse.io still sees one request every `gap` seconds, but a
Greenhouse board and an Ashby board run at the same time — that's what turns
~25 minutes of sequential fetching into ~4-5 minutes for the full catalog.
